### What is this repo?

In this repo I intend to put the solution for some coding problems. This problems will be training for me, but maybe it can help someone else. I'll try to attach some explanations for the solutions as I go. Feel free to comment on any solutions using issues any ideas, sujestions and doubts are welcome.

### Organization

I'll use this repo to display the problems I use to train algorithms and solution for simple an complex problems. For the purpose of training I'll solve these problems in many languages, hence the organization of this repo:

```
.
└── problem_name
    ├── README.md
    ├── solution.go
    |── solution.py
    └── ...
``` 

In the readme file I'll describe the problem and how I got to the solutions. I'll try to achieve optimal solutions, but I don't know all answers, so if anyone reading through this repo has some idea to make it better, faster or cleaner please write an issue for me and we can discuss about it.
